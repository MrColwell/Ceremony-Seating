# Ceremony-Seating

This little script is for organizing grad class entrance to the stage. Our students enter from both wings, and meet in the middle of their respective row, starting with the back row. The students are alphabetized, then broken into rows, then split to halfrows.

Version 3 implements a small change to allow the position of the alphabetically sorted students to start at any corner. You can also determine how many seats per row you would like.

Download the ZIP file, unzip to a folder of your choice.
Add the list of graduates, as a simple text file called: gradnames.txt
Make sure that there are no empty lines in the text file.
Run the gradSeating exe file.
You should see a new file called: gradsOrganized.txt
The new text file will have the order of students to form a double processional.
